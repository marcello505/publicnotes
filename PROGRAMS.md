Multimedia
==========

Home Cinema
-----------

[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) - No introduction needed, highly customizeble
and widely used on mutiple platforms.\
[Emby](https://emby.media/) - I use Emby to manage my Media library and
i have the Emby Add-on on Kodi so it automatically syncs.

Video and Movies
----------------

[MPV](https://mpv.io/) - Lightweight Media player with a suprising
amount of configuration in the config file. Just drag and drop.\
[MPC-HC](https://mpc-hc.org/) (Windows) - What i used before MPV, pretty
good with options for filters and such if you care to install them. I
prefer it over VLC but not as great as MPV.

Audio and Music
---------------

[Cmus](https://cmus.github.io/) - Lightweight terminal music player that
unlike a mpd player doesn't rely on a server backend.\
[Musicbee](https://getmusicbee.com/) (Windows) - Is what i used after
moving from Windows 7 looks nice by default and has mutiple skins
pre-packed.\
[Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) (Windows) - What i used in the
past, extremely customizible and extremely light on resources. May take
some time to set up according to your preferences.

Torrenting
==========

[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) - My main Torrenting
program, but everything else here is also reccomended.\
[Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/)\
[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) - Used to be Linux only but
recently got a Windows version.

Password Manager
================

[Keepass XC](https://keepassxc.org/) - Also has windows version.\
[Keepass 2](https://keepass.info/) (Windows) - Able to be run on Linux
with mono.\
[Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android)
(Android)

Screenshot Program
==================

[ShareNIX](https://github.com/Francesco149/sharenix) - Probably the best
Linux screenshot program ever. Just type in the command or bind the
command to a key combination, select an area and it will instantly
upload it and copy the link for you to paste.\
[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) (Windows) - Pretty customizable
screenshot program. Also has the option to record .gifs but i never got
it working when i was using it.

Image Viewer
============

[SXIV](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) - Simple and fast image viewer
with the option to pipeline image locations.\
[Honeyview](http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/) (Windows) - Fast image
viewer with nice options for customization. If you are using the default
windows image viewer then you're a cuck and you should get either
Honeyview or a different fast image viewer.

Utilities
=========

[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) - Bash replacement with auto-suggestions
and other helpfull features. Don't replace bash with it just have fish
auto launch whenever you open your terminal emulator. Having fish in
your bashrc file can also work but it can have issues.\
[Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) - Amazing program that
changes the colourscheme of your computer based on the background. With
a bit of work you can make it change the colours of almost every program
you use on a daily basis.\
[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) - Displays your
system information in a nice summary + an ascii art picture of your
distrobutions logo. Has the option to display a custom picture.\
[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) (Windows) - Program to search
your files, way faster than any stock windows search engine. Handy if
you need to find a file system wide. Helped me find stuff that i thought
was lost forever.\
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (Windows) - Package manager for
windows. Install, update and manage your applications the same way you
would on Linux. Haven't tried it out yet myself but looks pretty damn
promising.\
[DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke)](https://dban.org/) - Even if you delete
everything off a drive, some stuff can still be recovered using disk
recovery software. If you're ever selling a old harddrive it's a good
idea to completly wipe everything. Burn the ISO to a USB and boot into
it, select DoD for method and select the amount of passes. One pass is
fine. Three if you're paranoid or have particularly sensitive data.
[SCRCPY](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) - Ez android screen mirroring.
