Multimedia
==========

Home Cinema
-----------

[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) - No introduction needed, highly customizeble
and widely used on mutiple platforms.\
[Emby](https://emby.media/) - I use Emby to manage my Media library and
i have the Emby Add-on on Kodi so it automatically syncs.

Video and Movies
----------------

[MPV](https://mpv.io/) - Lightweight Media player with a suprising
amount of configuration in the config file. Just drag and drop.\
[MPC-HC](https://mpc-hc.org/) (Windows) - What i used before MPV, pretty
good with options for filters and such if you care to install them. I
prefer it over VLC but not as great as MPV.

Audio and Music
---------------

[Cmus](https://cmus.github.io/) - Lightweight terminal music player that
unlike a mpd player doesn't rely on a server backend.\
[Musicbee](https://getmusicbee.com/) (Windows) - Is what i used after
moving from Windows 7 looks nice by default and has mutiple skins
pre-packed.\
[Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) (Windows) - What i used in the
past, extremely customizible and extremely light on resources. May take
some time to set up according to your preferences.

Torrenting
==========

[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) - My main Torrenting
program, but everything else here is also reccomended.\
[Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/)\
[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) - Used to be Linux only but
recently got a Windows version.

Password Manager
================

[Keepass XC](https://keepassxc.org/) - Also has windows version.\
[Keepass 2](https://keepass.info/) (Windows) - Able to be run on Linux
with mono.\
[Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android)
(Android)

Screenshot Program
==================

[ShareNIX](https://github.com/Francesco149/sharenix) - Probably the best
Linux screenshot program ever. Just type in the command or bind the
command to a key combination, select an area and it will instantly
upload it and copy the link for you to paste.\
[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) (Windows) - Pretty customizable
screenshot program. Also has the option to record .gifs but i never got
it working when i was using it.

Image Viewer
============

[SXIV](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) - Simple and fast image viewer
with the option to pipeline image locations.\
[Honeyview](http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/) (Windows) - Fast image
viewer with nice options for customization. If you are using the default
windows image viewer then you're a cuck and you should get either
Honeyview or a different fast image viewer.

Utilities
=========

[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) - Program to search your files,
way faster than any stock windows search engine. Handy if you need to
find a file system wide. Helped me find stuff that i thought was lost
forever.
