\section{Multimedia}
	\subsection{Home Cinema}
		\href{https://kodi.tv/}{Kodi} - No introduction needed, highly customizeble and widely used on mutiple platforms.\\
		\href{https://emby.media/}{Emby} - I use Emby to manage my Media library and i have the Emby Add-on on Kodi so it automatically syncs.
	\subsection{Video and Movies}
		\href{https://mpv.io/}{MPV} - Lightweight Media player with a suprising amount of configuration in the config file. Just drag and drop.\\
		\href{https://mpc-hc.org/}{MPC-HC} (Windows) - What i used before MPV, pretty good with options for filters and such if you care to install them. I prefer it over VLC but not as great as MPV.
	\subsection{Audio and Music}
		\href{https://cmus.github.io/}{Cmus} - Lightweight terminal music player that unlike a mpd player doesn't rely on a server backend.\\
		\href{https://getmusicbee.com/}{Musicbee} (Windows) - Is what i used after moving from Windows 7 looks nice by default and has mutiple skins pre-packed.\\
		\href{https://www.foobar2000.org/}{Foobar2000} (Windows) - What i used in the past, extremely customizible and extremely light on resources. May take some time to set up according to your preferences.
\section{Torrenting}
	\href{https://www.qbittorrent.org/}{qBittorrent} - My main Torrenting program, but everything else here is also reccomended.\\
	\href{https://deluge-torrent.org/}{Deluge}\\
	\href{https://transmissionbt.com/}{Transmission} - Used to be Linux only but recently got a Windows version.
\section{Password Manager}
	\href{https://keepassxc.org/}{Keepass XC} - Also has windows version.\\
	\href{https://keepass.info/}{Keepass 2} (Windows) - Able to be run on Linux with mono.\\
	\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android}{Keepass2Android} (Android)
\section{Screenshot Program}
	\href{https://github.com/Francesco149/sharenix}{ShareNIX} - Probably the best Linux screenshot program ever. Just type in the command or bind the command to a key combination, select an area and it will instantly upload it and copy the link for you to paste.\\
	\href{https://getsharex.com/}{ShareX} (Windows) - Pretty customizable screenshot program. Also has the option to record .gifs but i never got it working when i was using it.
\section{Image Viewer}
	\href{https://github.com/muennich/sxiv}{SXIV} - Simple and fast image viewer with the option to pipeline image locations.\\
	\href{http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/}{Honeyview} (Windows) - Fast image viewer with nice options for customization. If you are using the default windows image viewer then you're a cuck and you should get either Honeyview or a different fast image viewer.
\section{Utilities}
	\href{https://www.voidtools.com/}{Everything} - Program to search your files, way faster than any stock windows search engine. Handy if you need to find a file system wide. Helped me find stuff that i thought was lost forever.
