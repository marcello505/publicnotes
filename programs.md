Multimedia
==========

Home Cinema
-----------

[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) - No introduction needed, highly customizeble
and widely used on mutiple platforms.\
[Emby](https://emby.media/) - I use Emby to manage my Media library and
i have the Emby Add-on on Kodi so it automatically syncs.\

Video and Movies
----------------

[MPV]() - Lightweight Media player with a suprising amount of
configuration in the config file. Just drag and drop.\
[MPC-HC]() (Windows) - What i used before MPV, pretty good with options
for filters and such if you care to install them. I prefer it over VLC
but not as great as MPV.\

Audio and Music
---------------

[Cmus]() - Lightweight terminal music player that unlike a mpd player
doesn't rely on a server backend.\
[Musicbee]() (Windows) - Is what i used after moving from Windows 7
looks nice by default and has mutiple skins pre-packed.\
[Foobar2000]() (Windows) - What i used in the past, extremely
customizible and extremely light on resources. May take some time to set
up according to your preferences.\

Torrenting
==========

[qBittorrent]() - My main Torrenting program, but everything else here
is also reccomended.\
[Deluge]()\
[Transmission]() - Used to be Linux only but recently got a Windows
version.\

Password Manager
================

[Keepass XC]() - Also has windows version.\
[Keepass 2]() (Windows) - Able to be run on Linux with mono.\
[Keepass2Android]() (Android)\

Screenshot Program
==================

[ShareNIX]() - Probably the best Linux screenshot program ever. Just
type in the command or bind the command to a key combination, select an
area and it will instantly upload it and copy the link for you to
paste.\
[ShareX]() (Windows) - Pretty customizable screenshot program. Also has
the option to record .gifs but i never got it working when i was using
it.\

Image Viewer
============

[SXIV]() - Simple and fast image viewer with the option to pipeline
image locations.\
[Honeyview]() (Windows) - Fast image viewer with nice options for
customization. If you are using the default windows image viewer then
you're a cuck and you should get either Honeyview or a different fast
image viewer.\

Utilities
=========

[Everything]() - Program to search your files, way faster than any stock
windows search engine. Handy if you need to find a file system wide.
Helped me find stuff that i thought was lost forever.\
